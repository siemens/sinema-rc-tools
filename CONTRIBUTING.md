## Guidelines

### Workflow

We use the
[Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
and review all changes we merge to the main branch.

We appreciate any contributions, so please use the [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
and send us Pull Requests!

### Commit Message

Commit messages shall follow the conventions defined by [conventional-changelog](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

> **HINT**: A good way to create commit messages is by using the tool `git gui`.
>
> **NOTE**: Changes supposed to be upstream shall structure the commit message
> according to the upstream project's guidelines.

#### What to use as scope

In most cases the changed component is a good choice as scope
e.g. if the change is done in the windows manual, the scope should be *windows*.

For documentation changes the section that was changed makes a good scope name
e.g. use *FAQ* if you changed that section.
